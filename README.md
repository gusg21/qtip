3. Extract All to wherever you want (Desktop, User Folder, etc.).
4. Edit mdin/in.md with the markdown of your page.
5. Run generate.bat.
6. Enter one of the styles given.
7. Open index.html!

### Uploading

1. To upload to a server, place index.html and the "core" folder in the same folder. **YOU NEED THE CORE FOLDER!!!**
2. Done!

### Adding your own stylesheets

1. Create a stylesheet.
  a. The stylesheet must be applicable to any html document! Basically, it can't use classes or ids. Just the default tags.
  b. The stylesheet must be all in ONE FILE!! No @imports!
2. Place it in core/style.
3. Run generate.bat and make sure it appears as "stylename" without the .css.

_P.S If you think that your style is good, fork it to me!_
